# 🔐 Secretly - Secure Credential Management

**Secretly** is a secure, team-oriented credential and secrets management platform built for developers and DevOps teams. It enables seamless sharing of API keys, tokens, and passwords inside organizations, with fine-grained access controls powered by Clerk and intelligent automation powered by AI.

Credentials are securely stored using [**Supabase Vault**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/vault), a native encryption service that ensures sensitive data is protected at rest and only accessible with the proper permissions.

## 🔐 Clerk Integration

Secretly deeply integrates Clerk to handle identity and access control. Here’s how Clerk is used:

### ✅ Authentication

- Sign up / sign in flow powered by Clerk prebuilt UI.
- Sessions and tokens managed securely.

### 👥 Organizations

- Users can create or join organizations (e.g., "Developers").
- Each organization is isolated with its own members and credentials.

### 🔑 Roles & Permissions

- Roles follow the format: `org:developer`, `org:admin`, etc.
- Permissions follow the format: `org:credentials:view`, `org:credentials:edit`, etc.
- Role and permission management is configured via the Clerk Dashboard and accessed programmatically through Clerk’s API.

### 📧 Inviting Members

- Owners can invite users to join their organization.
- Members join with limited or no access until assigned a role.

### 🔄 Switching Organizations

- Users can change organizations.
- Clerk context updates automatically to reflect the selected org.

## 🧠 AI Chat Bot Integration

Secretly integrates a custom chatbot that uses natural language to trigger actions via the Clerk API.
